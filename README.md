This repository is looking at ACL injuries in competition versus practice in varying high school sports.


## This Repository's Provenance
This data originated from a multisport comparison of ACL injuries in high school athletics from the [National Institute of Health](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3867093/).

## This Repository's Purpose
This repository's purpose is to analyze ACL injuries in competition versus practice, and then to compare and contrast the results of varying sports. 

## Potential Uses of This Repository
You can use this data to look at the sports that have the highest injury numbers, and use those numbers to assess and create a plan of how to lower the numbers of injuries.

Once you have downloaded English Project 3, you then want to go to the file named coLab documentation, this file is going to go step by step to demonstrate how to code the data.

HAPPY CODING!
