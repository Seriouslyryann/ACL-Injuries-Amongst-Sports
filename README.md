# ACL-Injuries-Amongst-Sports
This repository is looking at ACL injuries in competition versus practice in varying sports.

## Why Was this Repository Created?
This repository was created for my English 105 project in Professor Goetzler's class.

## Repository's Provenance
This data originated from a multisport comparison of ACL injuries in high school athletics from the [National Institute of Health](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3867093/).

## Purpose
This repository's purpose is to analyze ACL injuries in competition versus practice, and then to compare and contrast the results of varying sports. 

## Potential Uses
You can use this data to look at the sports that have the highest injury numbers, and use those numbers to assess and create a plan of how to lower the numbers of injuries.
