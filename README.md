# ACL-Injuries-Amongst-Sports
This repository is looking at ACL injuries in competition versus practice in varying high school sports.

## Why Was this Repository Created?
This repository was created for my English 105 project in Professor Goetzler's class.

## Repository's Provenance
This data originated from a multisport comparison of ACL injuries in high school athletics from the [National Institute of Health](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3867093/).

## Purpose
This repository's purpose is to analyze ACL injuries in competition versus practice, and then to compare and contrast the results of varying sports. 

## Potential Uses
You can use this data to look at the sports that have the highest injury numbers, and use those numbers to assess and create a plan of how to lower the numbers of injuries.
## Data Visualization
Here is a visualization of ACL injuries in varying high school sports in practice, competition, and the total of both practice and competition ACL tears.

## To Get Started 
To get started you can go to this repositories files and select the folder called data, in the is folder you should then select the file that says English Project 3, this is the original dataset that we will be manipulatiing and analyzing. Once you have downloaded English Project 3, you then want to go to the file named coding documentation, this file is going to go step by step to demonstrate how to code the data.

HAPPY CODING!
